Each module is distributed as a CSV files containing the text and a lot of metadata regarding the text. For those who are downloading the CSV file, keep in mind that a column of the file contains the text. For use in ordinary Corpus Linguistics software, like WordSmith Tools and Anticonc, this columns have to be extracted and saved as a single text file. If you have interest in doing so, please let me know.
