## Availability

This data is available in both CSV for free download and as a set of R commands for integrating data into R environment.

- Availability on CSV data might be [found here](doc/CSV_Download.md). 
- The R package has a set of functions responsible for downloading specific pieces of data. Please, see the [vignette](vignettes/) for a more detailed discussion.

### Organisation of each CSV module

Each module is distributed as a CSV file containing the text and some metadata regarding the text.The CSV files can be downloaded individually (see how to do it [here](doc/CSV_Download.md)).

For those who are downloading the CSV file, keep in mind that a column contains the text, but others are metadata.  See an example:


![Example CSV](Pictures/ExampleCSV.png)

For use in ordinary Corpus Linguistics software, like WordSmith Tools and Anticonc, these columns have to be extracted and saved as single text files. If you have interest in doing so, [please let me know][def], so I can provide a single file structure to you. 

### R Package and commands

Once you have installed the package (see instructions bellow) run:

```
download_index() 
View(IndexFunctions)
```
The first command will download a general index of the data available and the second will open the set of commands for data downloading. An example would be:

```
Committees006 <- download_Committees_006_data()
```
## R package

### Installation

In R, this package might be installed using `devtools`

    library(devtools)
    install_github("rll307/BrPoliCorpus")
